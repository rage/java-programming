### I've got a problem with the TMC plugin

Make sure you've got the newest version of the TMC plugin by clicking `Help` -> `Check for Updates` on the top bar of NetBeans.

If you can't make it work, ask on the [support channels](/support-and-assistance) or come to the workshop.

### NetBeans freezes when the feedback window opens

This problem shouldn't be present in the newer version of the plugin. You can download it by going on `Help` &rarr; `Check for updates` and following the instructions.

### I think one of the programming exercises has a bug

Please make sure the bug is not in your code. You may ask for help to spot a possible bug from one of the course's [support channels](/support-and-assistance). You can also test if there's an update to the exercise in NetBeans by selecting `TMC` &rarr; `Download` or update exercises from NetBeans' navigation bar. If you still believe there to be an error, please notify the course assistants through the [support channels](/support-and-assistance).

### I found an error in the material

Please contact the course assistants through the [support channels](/support-and-assistance).

If you are able to fix the error yourself, such as a typo, you can open a pull request in the course material's Github repository: https://github.com/rage/java-programming.

### How can I download the next part's exercises?

The TMC add-on for NetBeans will suggest you to download the next part's exercises once you've gained 25% or more of the previous part's exercise points.

### Doing the exercises and returning them is slow on macOS

Follow these instructions to fix the issue: https://materiaalit.github.io/tmc-asennus/macos-verkkoongelma/. The instructions are in Finnish, but you can seek guidance from the images until the instructions are translated.

If these haven't helped, try changing the proxy setting on NetBeans to "no proxy".

### The installer of NetBeans is not opening on macOS

Try right clicking on the installer and then choose "Open".

### The tests of part 12 are not working on my Mac

Check these instructions: [macOS instructions](/macos-ohjeet).

### While running the tests, I get an error about JAVA_HOME

Follow these instructions: [https://materiaalit.github.io/tmc-asennus/java_home_not_found/](https://materiaalit.github.io/tmc-asennus/java_home_not_found/). The instructions are in Finnish, but you can seek guidance from the images until the instructions are translated.

### While running the tests, I get an error about "Permission denied"

Open the Terminal and run the command `chmod +x /path/to/mvn`, where `/path/to/mvn` is the path that ends with `mvn` from the error message. If you require assistance, you may seek it through one of the [support channels](/support-and-assistance).

### NetBeans or its installer doesn't open, or looks odd when opening

Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 installed. The environment used on this course doesn't work properly with other versions of Java. If you have a problem with this, try removing the other versions of Java on your computer, and then [clear the old settings](/remove-netbeans-settings).

### The buttons to run and to send to the server on NetBeans are gray

This usually indicates either a passed deadline or a wrong course being selected in `TMC` &rarr; `Settings`.

### I want to apply for study right through the programming MOOC. Is this the right course?

No, you cannot apply for the study right based on this course.

### The next part should be opened today but I cannot access it

There is no guarantee on the exact time a course part will become available. The material has usually been released around midday, but the release time may vary greatly. Thank you for your patience!
