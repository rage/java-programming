<!-- TODO: koko kurssin recap -->

In this last part we looked into data visualization, displaying media programmatically and some third party libraries. We also took some time to create a little asteroid game. If you feel insipired you can keep adding features to the game you made.

We have now reached the end of the course. With the knowledge from this course you should be able to create your own programs with some research and it's in fact recommended to hone your programming skills with small projects. There is no way to cover all the information you need to be a succesfull programmer within one course. In fact programming is a constant learning process regardless if you are a seasoned professional developer or a newbie. Some of the thing left out of this course are: test and deployment automation, build systems, web server programming and much more.

We hope you enjoyed the course.

Please take a moment to answer the questionnaire below. Thank you!
