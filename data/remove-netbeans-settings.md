Sometimes NetBeans doesn't work beacuse of old settings files that are still present in the system. These instructions clear these old files.

# Windows
1. Close NetBeans/TMCBeans.
2. Open File Explorer.
3. Press `CTRL + L`.
4. Type `%APPDATA%` and press Enter.
5. From the folder that opens, remove the folder named `tmcbeans`.
6. Start NetBeans/TMCBeans.

# macOS
1. Close NetBeans/TMCBeans.
2. Open Finder.
3. Go to the home folder (`Shift + Command + H` in Finder). Usually Finder opens the home folder by default.
4. Remove the folder named `.tmcbeans`. If you do not see the folder, press `Command + Shift + piste`.
5. Start NetBeans/TMCBeans.

# Linux
1. Close NetBeans/TMCBeans.
2. Open the file explorer (sometimes called "Files").
3. Go to the home folder (`Alt + Home` in the file explorer). Usually the file explorer opens the home folder by default.
